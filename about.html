<h1>Hello!</h1>
<img src="SFL.jpg"/>
<p>My name is Sarah Lipworth and I am from Bloomfield Hills, MI. I am currently a student at Michigan State University studying graphic design and experience architecture. A lover of not just lions, but all animals. I like to golf, run, explore different cities, and spend time with my dogs, family, and friends. I consider myself to be a team player, creative, and organized. I'm not lion:)"</p>
